# Project Definition
Project is made for bachelor's in computer science at University of Helsinki.

The program will use Python as the main coding language and English as the main documentation language.

This program will be a rock-paper-scissors game where you compete against an AI that will try to learn your strategy and will use that knowledge to defeat you. 

### Algorithms that will be used
The AI will be created using a discrete Markov chain. Goal is to use O(n) time complexity.



## Input & Output
### Input:
The user will be able to pick between Rock, Paper or Scissors and that will be used as an input. (Possibly Lizard and Spock could be added later down the road.)

### Output:
The program will output if the user has won or lost against the program.
